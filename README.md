`hordelib` is a wrapper around [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) primarily to enable the [AI Horde](https://aihorde.net/) to run inference pipelines designed visually in the ComfyUI GUI.

The developers of `hordelib` can be found in the AI Horde Discord server: [https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn](https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn)

`hordelib` has been the default inference backend library of the [AI Horde](https://aihorde.net/) since `hordelib` v1.0.0.

## Purpose

The goal here is to be able to design inference pipelines in the excellent ComfyUI, and then call those inference pipelines programmatically. Whilst providing features that maintain compatibility with the existing horde implementation.

## Installation

If being installed from pypi, use a requirements file of the form:
```
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
hordelib

...your other dependencies...
```

#### Linux Installation

On Linux you will need to install the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit. Linux installers are provided by Nvidia at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Note if you only have 16GB of RAM and a default /tmp on tmpfs, you will likely need to increase the size of your temporary space to install the CUDA Toolkit or it may fail to extract the archive. One way to do that is just before installing the CUDA Toolkit:
```bash
sudo mount -o remount,size=16G /tmp
```
If you only have 16GB of RAM you will also need swap space. So if you typically run without swap, add some. You won't be able to run this library without it.

## Usage

Horde payloads can be processed simply with (for example):

```python
import os
import hordelib
hordelib.initialise()

from hordelib.horde import HordeLib
from hordelib.shared_model_manager import SharedModelManager

# Wherever your models are
os.environ["AIWORKER_CACHE_HOME"] = "f:/ai/models"

generate = HordeLib()
SharedModelManager.loadModelManagers(compvis=True)
SharedModelManager.manager.load("Deliberate")

data = {
    "sampler_name": "k_dpmpp_2m",
    "cfg_scale": 7.5,
    "denoising_strength": 1.0,
    "seed": 123456789,
    "height": 512,
    "width": 512,
    "karras": False,
    "tiling": False,
    "hires_fix": False,
    "clip_skip": 1,
    "control_type": None,
    "image_is_control": False,
    "return_control_map": False,
    "prompt": "an ancient llamia monster",
    "ddim_steps": 25,
    "n_iter": 1,
    "model": "Deliberate",
}
pil_image = generate.basic_inference(data)
pil_image.save("test.png")
```

Note that `hordelib.initialise()` will erase all command line arguments from argv. So make sure you parse them before you call that.

See `tests/run_*.py` for more standalone examples.

### Logging

If you don't want `hordelib` to setup and control the logging configuration initialise with:

```python
import hordelib
hordelib.initialise(setup_logging=False)
```

## Acknowledgments

`hordelib` depends on a large number of open source projects, and most of these dependencies are automatically downloaded and installed when you install `hordelib`. Due to the nature and purpose of `hordelib` some dependencies are bundled directly _inside_ `hordelib` itself.

## DMCA Abuse

On 26th May 2023 an [individual](https://github.com/hlky) issued a [DMCA takedown notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2023/05/2023-05-26-nataili.md) to Github against `hordelib` which claimed their name had been removed from the copyright header in the AGPL license in the 7 files listed in the takedown notice. This claim was true, and this attribution had been removed by a `hordelib` contributor prior to being committed into the `hordelib` repository. 

Unfortunately, it appears the individual making the DMCA claim was acting in bad faith, and even when their name was restored to the copyright attribution in the files, they persisted to press the DMCA takedown claim, which, due to the nature of the Github process, resulted in hordelib being subject to a DMCA takedown on Github.

This version of `hordelib` has the 7 files mentioned in the DMCA takedown removed and replaced with alternatives and the functionality required to run the AI Horde Worker was restored on 7th June 2023.

## Development

Requirements:
- `git` (install git)
- `tox` (`pip install tox`)
- Set the environmental variable `AIWORKER_CACHE_HOME` to point to a model directory.

Note the model directory must currently be in the original AI Horde directory structure:
```
<AIWORKER_CACHE_HOME>\
    clip\
    codeformer\
    compvis\
        Deliberate.ckpt
        ...etc...
    controlnet\
    embeds\
    esrgan\
    gfpgan\
    safety_checker\
```

### Running the Tests

Simply execute: `tox` (or `tox -q` for less noisy output)

This will take a while the first time as it installs all the dependencies.

If the tests run successfully images will be produced in the `images/` folder.

#### Running a specific test file

`tox -- -k <filename>` for example `tox -- -k test_initialisation`

#### Running a specific predefined test suite

`tox list`

This will list all groups of tests which are involved in either the development, build or CI proccess. Tests which have the word 'fix' in them will automatically apply changes when run, such as to linting or formatting. You can do this by running:

`tox -e [test_suite_name_here]`

### Directory Structure

`hordelib/pipeline_designs/`
Contains ComfyUI pipelines in a format that can be opened by the ComfyUI web app. These saved directly from the web app.

`hordelib/pipelines/`
Contains the above pipeline JSON files converted to the format required by the backend pipeline processor. These are converted from the web app, see _Converting ComfyUI pipelines_ below.

`hordelib/nodes/` These are the custom ComfyUI nodes we use for `hordelib` specific processing.

### Running ComfyUI Web Application

In this example we install the dependencies in the OS default environment. When using the git version of `hordelib`, from the project root:

`pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 --upgrade`

Ensure ComfyUI is installed and patched, one way is running the tests:

`tox`

From then on to run ComfyUI:

`cd ComfyUI`
`python main.py`

Then open a browser at: http://127.0.0.1:8188/

### Designing ComfyUI Pipelines

Use the standard ComfyUI web app. Use the "title" attribute to name the nodes, these names become parameter names in the `hordelib`. For example, a KSampler with the "title" of "sampler2" would become a parameter `sampler2.seed`, `sampler2.cfg`, etc. Load the pipeline `hordelib/pipeline_designs/pipeline_stable_diffusion.json` in the ComfyUI web app for an example.

Save any new pipeline in `hordelib/pipeline_designs` using the naming convention "pipeline_\<name\>.json".

Convert the JSON for the model (see _Converting ComfyUI pipelines_ below) and save the resulting JSON in `hordelib/pipelines` using the same filename as the previous JSON file.

That is all. This can then be called from `hordelib` using the `run_image_pipeline()` method in `hordelib.comfy.Comfy()`

### Converting ComfyUI pipelines

In addition to the design file saved from the UI, we need to save the pipeline file in the backend format. This file is created in the `hordelib` project root named `comfy-prompt.json` automatically if you run a pipeline through the ComfyUI version embedded in `hordelib`. Running ComfyUI with `tox -e comfyui` automatically patches ComfyUI so this JSON file is saved.

### Build Configuration

The main config files for the project are: `pyproject.toml`, `tox.ini` and `requirements.txt`

### PyPi Publishing

Pypi publishing is automatic all from the GitHub website.

1. Create a PR from `main` to `releases`
1. Label the PR with "release:patch" (0.0.1) or "release:minor" (0.1.0)
1. Merge the PR with a standard merge commit (not squash)


### Standalone "clean" environment test from Pypi

Here's an example:

Start in a new empty directory. Create requirements.txt:
```
--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
hordelib
```

Create the directory `images/` and copy the `test_db0.jpg` into it.

Copy `run_controlnet.py` from the `hordelib/tests/` directory.

Build a venv:
```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the test we copied:
```
python run_controlnet.py

The `images/` directory should have our test images.
```

### Updating the embedded version of ComfyUI

We use a ComfyUI version pinned to a specific commit, see `hordelib/consts.py:COMFYUI_VERSION`

To test if the latest version works and upgrade to it, from the project root simply:

1. `cd ComfyUI` _Change CWD to the embedded comfy_
1. `git checkout master` _Switch to master branch_
1. `git pull` _Get the latest comfyui code_
1. `git rev-parse HEAD` _Update the hash in `hordelib.consts:COMFYUI_VERSION`_
1. `cd ..` _Get back to the hordelib project root_
1. `tox` _See if everything still works_

Now ComfyUI is pinned to a new version.

### ComfyUI Patching

We patch the ComfyUI source code to:

1. Modify the model manager to allow us to dynamically move models between VRAM, RAM and disk cache.
2. Allow make ComfyUI output some handy JSON we need for development purposes.

To create a patch file:
- Make the required changes to a clean install of ComfyUI and then run `git diff > yourfile.patch` then move the patch file to wherever you want to save it.

Note that the patch file _really_ needs to be in UTF-8 format and some common terminals, e.g. Powershell, won't do this by default. In Powershell to create a patch file use: `git diff | Set-Content -Encoding utf8 -Path yourfile.patch`

Patches can be applied with the `hordelib.install_comfyui.Installer` classes `apply_patch()` method.
